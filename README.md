# Core Infrastructure Company Data Visualization

Welcome to the Core Infrastructure Company Data Visualization project! In this project, we embark on a journey to harness the power of Tableau, a leading Business Intelligence (BI) tool, to transform data into actionable insights. Our mission is to provide the Vice President (VP) and the entire team with valuable forecasts and analytical tools to enhance decision-making and optimize our company's core infrastructure.

## Project Overview

As the first step of our endeavor, the VP initiated an evaluation of available BI tools in the market. After a meticulous assessment, Tableau emerged as the ideal choice, aligning perfectly with our requirements. Leveraging Tableau's capabilities, we aim to equip our team with the ability to forecast sales for the upcoming year and predict the probability of refunds on a category-wise basis for the same period. These insights will enable the VP to strategize effectively and proactively address refund-related challenges.

## Key Objectives

Our project encompasses the following key objectives:

1. **Sales Forecasting:** Utilize Tableau's advanced analytics features to generate a robust forecast of our company's sales for the next year. This forecast will serve as a crucial foundation for future planning and resource allocation.

2. **Refund Probability Analysis:** Dive deep into our historical refund data, segmenting it by product categories. By leveraging Tableau's analytical capabilities, we aim to predict the probability of refunds for each category over the next year.

3. **Interactive Dashboard:** Develop a dynamic and user-friendly Tableau dashboard that empowers the VP and the team with actionable insights. The dashboard will feature:

   - A comprehensive list of orders returned by customers from the Top 10 Countries, ranked by refund frequency.
   - A visually appealing world map highlighting the Top 10 Countries with the highest refund rates.
   - Predictive models to estimate refunds category-wise for the upcoming year.
